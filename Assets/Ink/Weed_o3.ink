Hey! There's something different in the air today, can you feel it?

*[Yeah, the world seems friendlier.]
->Scene_One
*[I'm not sure, what do you mean?]
->Scene_One

===Scene_One===
It's as if the universe conspired to bring us together. You and me, sharing this journey, exploring the depths of our souls. I feel like the world has become brighter since we met.

*[I feel it too. There's a bond between us.]
->Scene_two
*[I've enjoyed our time together, but let's not rush things.]
->Scene_three

===Scene_two===
Indeed there is, love.
*[It's undeniable. I've never felt this way before but it feels like we’re going to fast]
->Scene_four
*[Our bond just feels unnatural, and I think it needs to stop.]
->END
===Scene_three===
Do you not enjoy our time together, love?
*[It's undeniable. I've never felt this way before but it feels like we’re going to fast]
->Scene_four
*[Our bond just feels unnatural, and I think it needs to stop.]
->END

===Scene_four===
Then we’ll slow down, love. I'm here to support you, to bring you peace and comfort. Together, we can navigate the highs and lows, and create a harmonious symphony in our hearts.
*[I’d love that…]
->END
*[I'm not sure if this is the right path for me.]
->END
