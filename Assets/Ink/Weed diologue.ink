flow with it. It's all about finding balance, you know?
*[ I guess you're right. I need to find some balance.]
You know… Stress can weigh you down if you let it. But remember, even in the busiest
of times, you can always find a moment of peace. It's about finding your own rhythm within the
chaos.
*[That's easier said than done. I've got deadlines and responsibilities.]
You know… Stress can weigh you down if you let it. But remember, even in the busiest
